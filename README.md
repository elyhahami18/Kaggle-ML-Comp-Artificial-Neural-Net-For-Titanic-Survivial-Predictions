# Tensorflow-Artificial-Neural-Net-TItanic-Predictions
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether or not a given passenger on the Titanic Survived (given a dataset that includes passenger's age, sex, socioeconomic class, embarking city, etc.). Numpy/Pandas for Pre-Proc, TensorFlow and Keras Libs to create ANN using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer.  

Experimenting various pre-proc methods/attributes that correlate highly with survivial, activation functions (sigmoid, ReLu, etc.), methods to reduce overfitting, various optimizers (Adam, SGD), various losses (binary_crossentropy, categorical_crosstropy, mean squared error, various learning rates, momentums (for SGD), etc. Used Gridsearh. Uploaded to Kaggle ML competition.
